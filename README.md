# Android Dev Challenge Compose - Bloom App

![Workflow result](https://github.com/noelchew/android-dev-challenge-compose-week-3/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
Bloom as a practice project to learn Jetpack Compose.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Have been using Android Views for many years. Apart from a brief experiment with Facebook Litho, this is the first time I am building native UI without using xml code. Looking forward to a stable version of Jetpack Compose.
